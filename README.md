## Documentation
@Todo The code itself is (mostly) documentated.
Currently im searching for a solution to use the comments in the code to autogenerate a documention out of it.

## Milestones
See [MILESTONES.md](./MILESTONES.md) to see what we want to achive/plans in upcoming verions

## Note
OpenHaus is in a very early development state.<br />
A good start is that you fireup [postman](https://www.postman.com/) import the collection (`postman.json`) and start to get familiar with the HTTP API. For better understanding, see the [üìÅ `components`](./components) folder and browser through the `index.js` files. Here is the schema defined how a "device", "room" or "user" object looks like.

I hope i found soon a solution to document things better...
